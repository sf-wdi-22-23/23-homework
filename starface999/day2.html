        <p>Over in London later today, the Guardian explains, composer Iain Chambers will premiere a new piece of music written for an unusual urban venue: "the caverns that contain the counterweights of [London's Tower Bridge] when it’s raised."  </p>
        <p>The space itself has "the acoustics of a small cathedral," Sinclair told the newspaper, citing John Cage as an influence and urging readers "to listen to environmental sounds and treat them as music," whether it's the rumble of a bridge being raised or the sounds of boats on the river.</p> 
        <p>The two central innovations of Letterist film were: (i) the carving of the image (la ciselure d’image), where the film-maker would deliberately scratch or paint onto the actual film stock itself. Similar techniques are also employed in Letterist still photography. (ii) Discrepant cinema (le cinéma discrépant), where the soundtrack and the image-track would be separated, each one telling a different story or pursuing its own more abstract path. The most radical of the Letterist films, Wolman’s The Anticoncept and Debord’s Howls for Sade, went even further, and abandoned images altogether. From a visual point of view, the former consisted simply of a fluctuating ball of light, projected onto a large balloon, while the latter alternated a blank white screen (when there was speech in the soundtrack) and a totally black screen (accompanying ever-increasing periods of total silence). In addition, the Letterists utilised material appropriated from other films, a technique which would subsequently be developed (under the title of 'détournement') in Situationist film. They would also often supplement the film with live performance, or, through the 'film-debate', directly involve the audience itself in the total experience. </p>
