<header>Nookzy, Inc.</header>
<p> Nookzy is a digital platform on which underutilized spaces can be listed by their owners/renters, and booked by people who want to hang out in them. In a way, then, it will operate as something of a hybrid between Zipcar and Airbnb (spatial rentals by the hour) for space. A user can log in to our app, search for a space that fits their time slot, budget, and other criteria, and book it (see figure below). On this platform, they can also make themselves visible to others who might want to join them, or, alternatively, book their space privately should they choose to do so. Rentable nooks come in all shapes and sizes, with many different features, prices, and feels. A nook could be a back yard, a rooftop, an alleyway, a treehouse, a room with a piano, a greenhouse, a shed, a rose garden, a sailboat, a pool with a view, a deck, a porch, a light well, a fire escape, or just a little nook between two buildings. Because there are so many interesting spaces in cities that hardly get any use, they could potentially be all over the place. Nookzy will curate these rentable spaces, and make improvements and add features to some of them as needed, in order to maximize their utility and make them as delightful and diverse as possible. Nookzy will determine the hourly value of rentable nooks, which sometimes will vary according to season, weather, and time of day for some outdoor nooks, and other factors for other nooks. The Nookzy app will give specific directions upon reservation, since the layout, features, and regulations for each nook are different. </p>
