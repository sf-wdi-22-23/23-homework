# Homework!

Congratulations on completing the first day of WDI!  In WDI, homework will usually be readings or tutorials to prepare you for the next day. Most days, you will also continue the day's exercises or lab during the evenings. 

## Dev Directory

We suggest students store their WDI work in a directory located at `~/dev`. Create this directory using the following terminal commands:

```bash
	cd ~
	mkdir dev
```

## Homework Repository

Each class will use a homework repository to submit homework. Right now, follow the instructions on your class's homework repository to get set up inside your `dev` directory.

## Homework Day 1

1. Read [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction). Mozilla Developer Network is a great source for information on web technologies.

1. Read our [CSS Overview](./css-overview.md) and work through the exercises. More in-depth CSS resources with exercises are linked at the bottom of that lesson! 

1. Inside your homework directory (`~/dev/22-homework/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` or `~/dev/23-homework/YOUR_GITHUB USERNAME`), make a `day1.hmtl` file. In that file, write three questions you have or things you learned from the HTML and CSS readings.  Structure your list as an HTML ordered list (`ol`) with list items(`li`).  Use CSS classes to style any questions bold. 

1.  Create a `passion_project.hmtl` file inside your homework directory.  Think of a "passion project" that you're excited to work on either as one of your formal WDI projects or after WDI. Write one paragraph about the project in the `passion_project.html` file. Use an HTML paragraph element (`p`).

1. Watch the video [Growth Mindset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN34FNbOKXc).

1. Read [Things I Wish Someone Had Told Me When I Was Learning How to Code](https://medium.com/@cecilycarver/things-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-when-i-was-learning-how-to-code-565fc9dcb329).

1. Also in the `passion_project.html` file, add a list of at least three pieces of advice from your experience or from these resources that will help you reach your goal of building your passion project. Structure the list as an HTML unordered list (`ul`) with list items(`li`).

1. Follow the submission instructions from your class's homework repo to push these changes to your GitHub account and submit a pull request.
