## Clients and Servers
Clients (ex. your computer) make requests to servers and servers send back responses. This is a really important mental model to have. Throughout this course, we'll be learning to write code that lives either on the client or on the server and it's important to know where it is.

Servers respond with `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript`, and/or pure data. Browsers have been created to know what to do with the code that servers send back.

Requests to servers are usually made in browsers but can also be made with `curl` requests in your terminal.
```
curl www.google.com
```

## Challenges

#### Base Challenges
  1. Go to your favorite website.
  4. Hit `command + option + i`
  5. You are now in the Elements tab of the Chrome Developer Tools. Click through the other tabs and explore!
  6. Back in the Elements tab, make some CSS changes using the Inspect Elements tool. Take a screenshot so you can show your work to a friend!

#### Stretch Challenges
  1. Go to the Console tab of the Chrome Developer Tools.
  2. Type `4 + 4` in the console, and hit `enter`.
  3. Now, type `hello world` - what does that return?
  4. Try it again, but this time with quotes, `"hello world"`. Much better!
