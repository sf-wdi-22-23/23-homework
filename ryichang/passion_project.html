				For my Passion Project, I would like to create a website / app that help individual users track fitness progress, gym schedule, and social engagement at the gym. The major focus would be for the individual user to conveniently check the website / app to know exactly how long it will take to get to the gym from their current location, because the hardest part of working out is going to the gym. The website / app will also display nearby gyms in the area and commute time to give users alternative options. Whereupon opening the website / app, if the user had a scheduled gym session, a countdown timer will be displayed instead until the user checks-in. To add a social aspect, individuals will be able to add their friends to their scheduled gym sessions. Additional functions include, notification for missing gym session, view other individuals at the gym, and log individual progress reports.

				<li>From the Growth Mindset TED talk, The Power of belief -- mindset and success by Eduardo Briceno, the greatest takeaway for me is keeping a growth mindset when facing challenges. I believe there will be many difficulties along the way in order to complete my project, having a positive attitude and openess in learning can help make these strides.</li>
				<li>As someone that is just starting out a journey in coding, I find it really reassuring reading the article Things I Wish Someone Had Told Me When I Was Learning How to Code by Cecily Carver. I really enjoyed reading her interpretation for coding as coding means something different for everyone and it is important to have an end goal.</li>
				<li>The last takeaway I had from Cecily Carver is her emphasis on "faith", that if I believe that with time and patience I can figure coding out, in time I almost certianly will and that being stuck is just a process of finihing the final puzzle piece by piece.</li>
