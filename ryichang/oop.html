       <header><em>What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?</em></header>
       <p>The constructor is a method of the class. In Javascript the function serves as the constructor of the object, every action declared in the class gets executed at the time of instantiation. When using the prototype, method definitions are separated from the class. </p>
       <hr>
       <header2><em>What does "this" mean inside a constructor?</em></header2>
       <p>When this is inside a constructor, this is set to the object where the function is from. If this is calling from a variable, this can become a global object.</p>

       <header3>Other Questions</header3>
       <p>I am still a little uncertain about constructor and prototype, in terms of advantages and when one should use one over the other. </p>
