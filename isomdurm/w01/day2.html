          <ul>
           <li>I have been having conflicting difficulties between Ruby standards and Javascript standards. I have not learned enough about either to fully grasp the use of the language, but more so about JS. Is there a way I can try to get off of the Ruby Bandwagon to reroute my education process?</li><br>
           <li>Throughout these lessons for this homework, I am also having difficulty grasping the white board method for code. Once I see it now, I know exactly what it means and does, such as the if, then, for, while, etc., but I do not feel comfortable writing it blankly. This coincides with the previous question. There's a clear element I am not grabbing by the horns.</li><br>
           <li>I would love loVE LOVE to start using the Ternary Operators instead of the other method, but again, I am having trouble transitioning from each. How can we solve this?</li>

          <ul>
           <li>The shorter, the better. Arrays and crucial to compacting information, but so is writing fuctions with fluent visibility. A practice of mindful correlation will be due.</li><br>
           <li>Gathering User Input and storing, in accordance with the first FUI, will be the most successful path. Crocheting those together will be of utmost importance.</li><br>
          <li>KEY. BOARD. SHORT. CUTS. that is all.</li>
