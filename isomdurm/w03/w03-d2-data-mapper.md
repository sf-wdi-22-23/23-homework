Look at the data inside this directory's data.js file. How would you model this data with JavaScript object types?

	? ALERT: Brain fried, so not sure if I am able to understand syntax at this hour. 'Model', refers to displaying the information? 

	JS object types, meaning things such as typeof, instanceof, and what they return? I would be modelling the data using the returned strings, such as object, string, object, etc.? 

Imagine we're storing and working with a large amount of hobbies. What attributes would you include on a Hobby object type? What methods might you create for a Hobby object type to help us manage hobby data?

	? Attributes: unique id? I'm assuming this is the 'only' way to sort editable data.

Imagine we're storing and working with a large maount of cohorts. What attributes would you include in a Cohort object type? What methods might you create for a Cohort object type to help us manage cohort data?

	? unique id, again. Don't quite understand. I guess I'm confused as to what an 'object type' is? I thought object type was the returned string when getting typeof, etc.?

Think back to the lab from today and to other interactions you've had with data. Object data Mappers give us tools to work with any kind of data. What attributes might you give a generic DataObject object type? What methods might you give a generic DataObject object type based on the ways weve been using data so far?

	? I think I completely understand how to do this, assuming it's been fine, but it might be the time, and it might be the syntax. I am very confused in this moment. I apologize.
