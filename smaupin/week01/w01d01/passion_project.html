		<p>Passion Project <br>So Far I have only very vague ideas of what a passion project would be with what I will learn from WDI. One of the ideas that I seem to stick on however is using a speech-to-text function from a computer or mobile device, then cataloguing the words it hears over an extended period of time, and basically providing real-time feedback for the speaker (or speakers) in the form of (but not limited to) a color representation of the data as a whole. For instance if I have set it up to identify certain words as 'positive language' and code those red, certain words for 'negative language' and code those blue (for instance) and words classified 'neutral' have no effect on the final color, make the screen display the current mix of 'positive and negative' language in a color, and that color shifts gradually as the speech continues. If a reddish color, the overall language has been more positve, if blueish it has been more negative, and a perfectly even ratio would look purple. That sort of thing.</p>

		<ul>Advice from Homework Resources
			<li>Always make sure your tags are properly nested. One must close before the one around it closes.</li>
			<li>Have mechanisms or ways to destress set up before building to help when I'm frustrated or at a roadblock.</li>
			<li>Turn the problem over in your mind, looking for better ways to do things or more efficient ways to do the things that you are doing. Be open to multiple possible solutions.</li>
