          <ul>Q: List three input types and give real world examples of when you might use each of them. (ex. password inputs can be used for login forms)
            <li>1: Radio Button - When you want to find out for instane where a consumer heard about your site, (a friend, banner ad, tv, etc)</li>
            <li>2: Text Area - to accept comments but make sure they are of a certain brevity, like you must describe your issue in 200 words or less.</li>
            <li>3: Dropdown list - Allowing a user to organize search results, for instace from cheapest to most expensive, newest to oldest, most popular to least, and all vice versa as well.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <ul>Q: In your own words, write definitions (no more than one sentence) for client, server, and API.
            <li>Client: The computer (usually) making the request to the server. Also the portal through which humans interface with the internet and servers.</li>
            <li>Server: The larger, more powerful computer that is only programmed to recieve requests, and then send responses based on the instructions in those requests, and sometimes send a message back telling the client it can either not fulfill or not understand the request.</li>
            <li>API: This is an Application Programming Interface, which I think describes its function well. They are datasets organized in a very specific way so that computer programs know how to parse them and extract the information they need, and they are usable for multiple clients in sometimes different ways.</li>
