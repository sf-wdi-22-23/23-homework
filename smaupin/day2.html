        <ul>Questions I have about the Homework:
          <li>In the javascript-primatives.md I am having a hard time with #10 in the exercises. I think I need some hand holding on this one. Have googled, but still not sure the correct answer.</li>
          <li>What's the most efficient way to sort the list in an exercise shortly after that one into key-object pairs? I managed to do one, but it feels clunky and ineficient.</li>
          <li>I'm getting to my homework late, but very determined to keep up. How badly is this screwing me with regards to the WDI course? Can I reover if I really focus and put in extra time this weekend?</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>Three things I think I'll use later:
          <li>All the sub-commands for arrays
              <ul>
                <li>.join</li>
                <li>.split</li>
                <li>.reverse</li>
                <li>.splice</li>
              </ul></li>
          <li>"/\d/" is looking for digits 0-9</li>
          <li>Working with how to sort arrays and predicting the ultimate outcomes correctly.</li>
