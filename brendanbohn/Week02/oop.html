	<h3>What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?</h3>
	<p>When using a constructor, methods within that constructor are stored in every instance of that constructor. With a prototype, each new instance simply points to the prototype and does not store the method within itself.</p>
	<h3>What does this mean inside a constructor?</h3>
	<p>Using "this" inside of the constructor refers to that particular constructor. Using "this," you don't need to continually repeat writing the constructors name.</p>
