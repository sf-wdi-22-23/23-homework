The data in the javaScript could be organized by objects-- a cohort object and a hobby object.

The hobby object can include how popular a hobby is, how difficult it is, whether it is done inside or outside, etc.

The cohort object can include a student array that contains objects about students, the cohort's nickname, the start and end dates, etc.

Methods could be add a new cohort/hobbies, and ways to manipulate them.
