	<h1>Passion Project</h1>
	<p>One issue that has stood out to me lately is the refugee crises of the Middle East. I have seen pictures and videos of Europeans bringing supplies to trains for the arriving refugees and I would be interested in making an app or website that facilitated donations in situations such as this.</p>
	<h2>Advice from my experience or from these resources that will help me reach my goal of building my passion project: </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>"It never works the first time. And probably won't the second or third time." - Cecily Carver (Things I Wish Someone Had Told Me When I Was Learning How to Code) </li>
		<li>'There are almost always many different approaches to a particular problem, with no single “right way.”' - Cecily Carver (Things I Wish Someone Had Told Me When I Was Learning How to Code) </li>
		<li>Maintain a growth mindset. </li>
		<li>Remember why I am getting into coding and what I want to get out of it. </li>
