<!-- Include Bootstrap in day2.html, and set up a two column layout. 

Inside day2.html, in your left column, use a <ul> to write at least 
three questions you have about the homework. In the right column, 
use a <ul> to write three things you think you'll use later.

Use the homework submission instructions from the 22-homework
or 23-homework repo to submit your homework through a pull request!
