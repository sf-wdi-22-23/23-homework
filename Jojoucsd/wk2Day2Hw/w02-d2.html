Hw week 2 Day 2:

Three types of Input:

<input type ="text">type attribute can be ommited<input>
real world example: I think where most blogs comment area or email body will also use this <input type ="text"> It's very general without many validations rules and users can input most general data without getting check by the computer.

<input type="password">echoes dots instead of characters<input>
real world experience: password input where you have validations certain characters are not mean to type in the text area. for example like "space". similar to email input, where the script usually will validated if users input an "@" and check for no space in the inputs.

<input type="submit">post action<input>
real world experience: submit is an action, a trigger to the form. Like when you write a email the picture the texts of the emails will not send to the severs until we hit submit. And once the submit button is clicked. The submit wraps all the users input in the an object send to severs.

API is the highway connect two locations, which server is a bigger city has multi API and client just a small town only has one connection to server by API.

A little confuse with the "PUT" mathod and "XML", 
and since we have jQuery in the mix from my understanding. How is that added to the understanding of API? when we clicked and "listener" than the listeners also perform a "Get" "POST" "PUT" ? I think I need more time to revisit the materials and try to understand better.
