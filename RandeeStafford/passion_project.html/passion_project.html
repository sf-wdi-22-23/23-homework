		<p> I would like to bring the tech world to the kids that I worked with in East Palo Alto. I would like to have a workshop for the youth but mainly the young ladies that really are interested in the tech field but are not sure how to become active it that field. I was able to work with some youth over the summer and I would love to help those youth create a new passion. </p>

			I would try to find a grant in that area to help with funding for a space and materials. Also go out and recruit youth and local schools and after school programs. Make sure to be patient and have fun!
