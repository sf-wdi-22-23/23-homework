var bestCohorts = [ { id: 24, subject: "WDI", number: 22, classroom: 1},
                    { id: 43, subject: "WDI", number: 23, classroom: 2} ]

var hobbies = [ {name: "boating", cost: "very high"},
                {name: "knitting", cost: "low"},
                {name: "cooking", cost: "moderate"} ]

If we are working with a large number of hobbies, we can try to give them more attributes to help categorize them further.  Fitness level required could be a good one.  Space requirements.  I'm not really sure what methods would help manage the data.

Some attributes to add to the bestCohorts objects might be dates, number of students, location of cohort.  Again, I'm not sure what the question is asking about methods to manage the data.

Assigning a specific Id number to an object helps to easily identify and distinguish it from other like objects.
