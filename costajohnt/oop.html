    	<li>A prototype has no class, a constructor is a method called at the moment an object is instantianted.  Its contained in a class and usually shares the same name with its class.  This has to do with inheritance.  A class can inherit characteristics from another class. A constructor is a function that is called with the 'new' operator.  I'm having trouble understanding the difference between the two and why it matters, but the main distinction I'm seeing is that constructors are class dependent and prototypes are class independent, but I'm not even sure if I understand what that means.
</li>
    	<li>(this) inside a constructor refers to the name of the function or object.</li>
    	<li>I'm not really understanding closures.  I'm also not really understanding the difference between constructors and prototypes and how to use them.  I looked at some analogies for OOP and I think I'm beginning to wrap my head around the concept, but I feel like I'm still pretty far away from understanding it.</li>
