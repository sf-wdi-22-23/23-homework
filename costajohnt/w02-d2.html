    	<li><b>List three input types with real world examples</b><br>
    	1. Credit card information on an ecommerce website so you can buy that toilet paper from Amazon you need and have it delivered to the door.<br>
    	2. Filling in answers to a google survey<br>
    	3. Placing a bid for an item on ebay.</li>
    	<li><b>What's a client? server? API?</b><br>
    	A client is the interface that the user interacts with.  Based on user input, the client makes requests from the server or API and brings the data back to the user.<br>
    	A server stores data and other stuff that the user can access through the client.  Servers are typically big computers in uninteresting places, but any computer can be a server if its sending information to a client.
    	<br>
    	An API makes it faster and easier for a client to access data because it doesnt have to go all the way to the server for the information.  API's allow computers to talk to one another.

    	3. Is understanding JSON the most important take away?</li>
