    <p> I'm interested in creating an app that can parse information from multiple sources into a central location and determine a logical order of operations.  Specifically, I want to make an app that can take food orders from multiple sources, like GrubHub and Eat24, and display them together for a courier on mobile.  The courier has central access to orders that arrived in the system at a similar time and are headed to delivery addresses in the same neighborhood.  After a group of orders had been determined, the app will map out the most efficient drop off route based on time, distance, topography, and preferred bicycle route in google maps so that the courier can simply ride the efficient route without having to determine it herself. </p>

    	<li>Break the problem down into the smallest pieces you can.</li>
    	<li>Use google and any other resources you can to try and figure out a problem you are stuck on.</li>
   		<li>It probably won't work the first time but keep at it and you can make it happen.</li>
    </ul>
