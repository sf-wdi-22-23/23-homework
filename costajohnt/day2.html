        <h1>Questions</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>In question number four of the first section of homework there is a list of names in a string and the tast is to sort them and then reverse the order.  I'm not sure how to make it work.</li>
      <li>I understand conditionals, but I think I need switch statements explained to me maybe five more times because I don't understand how they work, or at least how to read them</li>
      <li>For the last section in the first part of the homework, I'm not really sure if I should write up the information in a nested array or an associated array.</li>
      <li>There was one question that asked you to find the median number in an array of 35 numbers.  First I put the numbers in order with .sort, but the single digit numbers were out of order.  I was looking at the (a,b)(a-b) part that magically makes it work but I don't understand why.  Also, I used a variable, halfLength, to find the median iterator of the array, but I couldn't figure out how to make it spit out the median array element and not just the iterator</li>

        <h1>Things I'll use later</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I'm sure I'll be using some of the methods discussed, like .splice, .lengthOf, etc.</li>
      <li>Conditional statements will be very useful, and when I understand how to use switch statements it will be even better.</li>
      <li>Functions!</li>
