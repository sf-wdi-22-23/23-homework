					<h2>Questions from Homework</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype? <br>
						&nbsp; The constructor is the function that is called when the prototype is instantiated. The prototype, or class, is the collection of keys or properties for what values will be needed inside the constructor. 
						</li>
						<hr>
						<li>What does <em>this</em> mean inside a constructor? <br>
						&nbsp; 'This' refers to whatever the next layer of scope is. It could be the class where the constructor function is attached to. If we are creating an object called 'Jorge', // (var Jorge = new Person(); // and we called 'this' in there. It would be referring to 'var Jorge'. 
						</li>

					<ul>
						<li>I am not quite sure I understand inheritance. Is inheritance when you have a method in a parent and instantiate a child? That method would not really be present in the constructor of the child but it could be called from the parent? </li>
						<hr>
						<li>Abstraction and polymorphism seem very abstract right now. That went right over my head. I will look at it again tomorrow.</li>
