		<h1>Passion Project</h1>

		<p>I have been thinking for some time about figuring out a way to make classical music more accessible for curious new listeners. Most people are turned off by the "pretentiousness" of the art environment because of how obscure it can seem. I would love to come up with a solution that can show a curious listener that:</p>

		<ul>
			<li> Symphonic works are not all long and boring.</li>
			<li> Opera singers, in most cases, are not fat ladies scream-singing while wearing viking hats.</li>
			<li> Piano music is so much deeper than just fast notes.</li>
			<li> Understanding musical expression will change one's life.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The ideal way would be to engage the musical community in this process somehow. Maybe by musicians having a way in which they can submit posts for approval. And select a few every day along with a brief and down-to-earth description. The user interface would be extremely crucial to maintain engagement. Having different easy to navigate sections separating classical sub-genres furthermore helping to help the ear focus interest and taste.</p>

		<h2>Reading &amp Video</h2>

		<p>The video and reading are AWESOME! My favorite three pieces of advice are:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>From the reading: "I've found that a big difference between new coders and experienced coders is faith: faith that things are going wrong for a logical and discoverable reason, faith that problems are fixable, faith that there is a way to accomplish the goal. The path from not working to working might not be obvious, but with patience you can usually find it."</li>
			<li>From the video: "Listen for your fixed mindset voice and talk back with a growth mindset voice. If you hear yourself saying 'I can't do it...' add 'yet.'" </li>
			<li>From the reading: "Theres no point in being intimidated or wondering if you're Smart Enough." </li>
		</ol>
