				<ul>
					<li>List three input types and give real world examples of when you might use each of them.
						<ul>
							<li>Drop-down lists - can be used in forms to select from preconceived options. Very frequently used to select security questions for password recovery.</li>
							<li>file picker - used to select a file to upload somewhere or manipulate in some way.</li>
							<li>radio - can be used on surveys perhaps to rate from 1-5.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<hr>
					<li>In your own words, write definitions for client, server, and API.
						<ul>
							<li>Client - The computer who is making data requests (fetching) from the server by interacting with the interface.</li>
							<li>Server - Where all the information is stored and is accessed (provided) when requested as it is consistently listening for a request event.</li>
							<li>API - Simplifies web data organization, can be accessed by the client as it is stored in a server, and makes it easier to automate tasks. </li>
						</ul>

				<div class="h2">Questions from Reading</div>
				<ul>
					<li>I had a bunch of questions after the 1st reading on HTML forms. That reading should be second. All the questions were cleared up when I read the Zapier's reading and went back to the first reading. Then I understood what the need for the "name" field in a form tag is. It defines the attribute the form element is related to.
