				<h3>Homework Questions</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>When doing a sort() with numbers, I would like to better understand the <em>function(a,b){ return a-b }</em>. So mysterious!</li>
						<li>Was not sure what was the mission of exercise #10. Only thing I could think of was writing them down manually into arrays and nested arrays.</li>
						<li>Was not quite sure what a case for using a regular expression would be. (match?)</li>
					</ul>

			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6 questions">
				<h3>Things I'll Use Later</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Definitely Bootstrap - How beautiful is all.</li>
						<li>I really enjoyed using the methods for the execises. So... METHODS!</li>
						<li>Need to go back and watch the sublime shortcuts video 1,000 times. I'm sure it will get easier to get those shortcuts into muscle memory in time.</li>
