			<li>Today I got a clearer understanding of GitHub and the purposes of fork, clone, add, commit, push, or pull requests. It had been a little harder the first time around on the pre-course work.</li>

			<li class = "question">I understand how to link a separate CSS file to the header section. What is the standard way of organizing related files on Git and pushing them onto the remote git in an orderly fashion?</li>
			
			<li class = "question">From the CSS readings it seems a little innefficient and bulky to have classes being overidden by IDs. Is it standard practice to leave completely unused styling in the CSS?</li>
