  <title>Meredith's Passion Project</title>

<body>
	<p>Plate Safe is my passion project, something, I’m very aware about and affects my everyday life as well as millions not to mention the hundreds of thousands of people that travel to San Francisco each year. With restaurants on every corner it’s hard to feel safe knowing each cooks there food differently and ingredients vary. I'd like to create a usable app showcasing restaurants nearby that accomodate to certain food allergens. I want to be able to dine out and know what's on the menu with real time reviews from others.</p>
	  <ul>
	  	<li>To achieve a can do mindset even for the large scope of the project</li>
	  	<li>To pull from Yelp's API? and realizing it may not work the first, second, or even third try – but still staying positive.</li>
	  	<li>Time management practices and completing from the outside in</li>
	  </ul>
