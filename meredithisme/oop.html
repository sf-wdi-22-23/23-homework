  <h1>What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?</h1>

  <p>A constructor is a function created once the class is intiated. Where as a prototype acts as a class without needing to be defined. It is shared with multiple instances. Using the prototype method gives you a clean way to separate properties common to all instances and instance-specific ones. </p>

  <h1>Why do you want to use this in the constructor method?</h1>
  <p>It's mainly about structure and not wasting memory. You can add functions to an object in a constructor function.</p>
