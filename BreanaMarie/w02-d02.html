<h1>List three input types and give real world examples of when you might use each of them.</h1>
<p>
	The Radio button: its a quick way to get a true false response from a user.  Click one or the other, are you male or female.  if the button is checked the answer is true, if the button is not clicked the answer is false.  another example is "click all that apply to what you like..." you can have multiple answers of true to one question, meaning that a person can "like" lots of different items on the list.</br>
	Drop-down list: I have most commonly seen in navigation bars as menues.  This fancy little feature lets you hide a list of options until the a user is ready to interact with them.</br>
	Submit button: the simple effetive submit button that sends a post to the server.  This handy little button is found on just about every form that needs to be sent off to have the data stored somewhere.

<h1>In your own words, write definitions (no more than one sentence) for client, server, and API./h1>
<p>The client is the one asking for information from the server </br>
The server is the file cabinet that holds all the data that a client would ask for</br>
The API is the way the data is sorted so a computer can utlize it</p>
