<h1>What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?</h1>
<p>Constructor is a method that takes and applies a method to an object is created.  The class and name are usually the same.  The Protype-based programing reuses or inherits performance from other objects by cloning them.  </br> 
In short in Protype objects inherit from objects and Constructor based programing is clases and instances based</p>
<h1>What does this mean inside a constructor?</h1>
<p>'This' would not inherit its properties automatically.  Objects are defined by a constructor and then instantiated using a new keyword.  
"Constructors create the blueprints for objects, not the object itself."</p>
