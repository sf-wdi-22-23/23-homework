	<!-- These are my questions and comments from day 1 reading -->
	<ol>
		<li> Question 1: not a question, but after reading about named character references or entities i was interested to find out what other items/symbols had tag delimiters.  i found the list of symbols provided by the article <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#named-character-references" class="external external-icon" title="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#named-character-references">found here </a>, to be very helpful.
		</li>
		<li>
			Question 2: not so much a question but after reading the CSS information and the comparison to a picture frame i started thinking about liquid sites and how setting specific sizes of blocks would impact the various size screens.  Is is better to design in liquid format or in stactic format?
		</li>
		<li>
			Question 3: not much else on my mind related to the HTML and CSS articles.
		</li>
		<li> Additional comment: kudos to the writer Cecily Carver.  The idea that "the difference between new coders and experienced coders is faith ..."  Although my time coding is relatively short, I know how important it was to find that first break in my code and fix it was.  That bit of confidence that is  needed to know that you can find that little missing ";" or misspelled variable and correct it to make it all better ... or not and you have to find the next break. 
		</li>
		<li> Additional comment: but after watching the video about the power of belief I found the message positive, and overall interesting that a small change in sentence of “I can’t” to “I can’t yet” can impact ones ability to learn and be interested in the material  they are exposed to.</li>
