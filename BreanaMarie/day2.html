        <h1>Questions for Day 2 homework</h1>
        <ul> Question 1: in JavaScript converting a number to a string you are using (1).toString()  since the '.' can make things complicated based off of the example 1.toString and 1..toString is it consiered best practice to use the '()' around the number you wish to make a string?  </ul>
        <ul> Question 2: When dealing with an array and you want to change the order of just two values in the array and they are not on the end or begining, and you don't want to change any other values what is the best practice? pop everything and then push it all back in in the right order? </ul>
        <ul> Question 3: no additional questions</ul>

        <h1>Useful points from Day 2 homework</h1>
        <ul> Point 1: the break down to either 0 or 1 always.  This is especialy important when in true and fals statements and converting to the operators.  I have had a little trouble with this area and will need to focus a little extra hard on this</ul>
        <ul> Point 2: Really like the keyboard shortcuts video, i wish i would have had this before we started school, maybe as a suggested reading for before class started, just because it so useful. cammand delete is my new friend :)</ul>
        <ul> Point 3: coming from a more traditional learning background, I felt a little better knowing that this concept called Inverted learning had an actual title.  I admit I am feeling a little uncomfortable with the class structure so far.  With learning how to use a MAC coming from PC, in addition to a new environment and class structure its a bit of an adjustment.  Seeing a video that addresses at least one of these videos helps make me feel not so alone in this process.  guess I take away a little more confidence that I will feel better about this whole process of learning given a little  more time.</ul>
