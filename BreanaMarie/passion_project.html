	I have several project i want to look into, however the largest and most exciting one is an interactive website that requires a login for users that prevents unregistered users from accessing all content, and a specialized set of forms.  The forms are my biggest focus, each form needs to be dynamic, and based off of the type of input, a numeric value is given that will interact with running total specific to the user.  This would be similar to how a shopping cart keeps track of how much money is spent.  </br>
	Each time a user logs in, they can access their total "points" and can "purchase" perks with those points from a list on the form.  The form would need to changed or update every time a field is manipulated.  However, once all the points are used, the form needs to be inactive.   I also want to be able to add more points to a users total coffer, but prevent any fields from being modified once the points have been used to purchase something on the form.  </br>
	But I want to note that this site is <strong>EVEN BIGGER</strong> than that. I have a dream company I want to build that has a large website with many different parts to it.  The more I code the more i want to add to it.  For example, the rock, paper, scissors project i am already taking and tweaking to fit into my website.  </br>
	Another part to this site is wardrobe builder.  I am not sure quite how this will work, but i want to be able to reference various garb and have it link to a database that will tag it with information like who uses it, how t find it and alternatives to that particular piece. </br>
	Given the size of this project I don't think this will be something I want to try and complete within class as one of the projects, but could maybe do part of it as project or inspire an in class project.
