<!--Include Bootstrap in day2.html, and set up a two column layout.

Inside day2.html, in your left column, use a <ul> to write at least three questions you have about the homework. In the right column, use a <ul> to write three things you think you'll use later.-->

				<h1>Questions about the Homework</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>I had a lot of trouble working with Arrays. I guess that's not really a question, but I need more work with them. I couldn't find the median, even after Googling ways to do it.</li>
					<li>Is there anything a function can't be used for?</li>
					<li>I still don't understand callbacks...</li>

				<h1>Things to use later</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>That alt option for scrolling word to word is amazing! And lines too.</li>
					<li>'Redo' is different in every program. Def a useful shortcut to remember.</li>
					<li>cmd+d will be super handy for changing variable or funtion names. I anticipate needing that. (cmd+control+g)</li>
