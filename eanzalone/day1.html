<h1>HTML Reading!</h1>
	<h3>Thoughts</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>I didn't realize you couldn't overlap 'strong' and 'em' tags. (And I assume other tags as well.) I bet that makes things messy.</li>
			<li>"Do not close empty elements in HTML mode." But it's only talking about Firefox? Is it good practice to close them anyway?</li>
			<li>I never put two and two together to understand why quotes/ampersands/etc were written as codes in HTML. It makes so much sense now!</li>
		</ol>
<h1>CSS Reading!</h1>
	<h3>Thoughts</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>When you create an entirely separate stylesheet and just link it to your HTML doc, how does the computer know what pages it's putting together? This applies to other langauges as well.</li>
			<li>None of my box model images loaded. :(</li>
			<li>Those shorthands actually look longer. I'm confused.</li>
