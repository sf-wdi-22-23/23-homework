# UX and Workflow

1. Facebook:
	* new users can sign-up and create an account
	* existing users can login
	* after login, users can edit personal information, post things, or view other users information and posts
2. Outside-in means starting with what the end user sees and working back. Views -> Client-side -> Server-side
3. console.log, chrome devtools, google search


# Project 1 Review

1.
	* come up with user narratives
	* define user schema
	* layout templates for views
	* server-side GET routes to show templates
	* client-side eventlisteners
	* client-side ajax
	* server-side POST and PUT routes

2. In the future I would plan to have more complete user narratives and wireframes before continuing with anything else.

3.
 i.  NavBar should be loaded with session user data while rest of the page should be loaded with all users data from database
 ii. Creating separate routes for session data and non-session data
 iii. Can't GET some pages depending on path. I have different paths trying to show same page.
 iv.

# Resourcefulness

1. I searched for a list of Django authentication packages and found Django Rest Framework was the most used.
 * current version is stable production
 * works in python 3
 * most used django authentication package which means it should have the best support
