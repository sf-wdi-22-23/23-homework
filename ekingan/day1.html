    <ol>
    <li> I learned that when using HTML, you need to write ampersand plus gt and lt, instead of the > and < symbols to signify greater than and less than.
        </li>
        <li>
        <div class="question">
        How do you write an html tag as a string? It seems like you cannot put it in quotes like you would in Javascript or Ruby?
             </div>
            </li>
        <li>

            </li>
