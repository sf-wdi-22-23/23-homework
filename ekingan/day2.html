          I do not understand what a ternary operator is or what it is used for.
          </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>
          I am not always clear when to use a "while" loop.
          </p>
          </li>
          <li> <p>
          I would like to learn how to embed Javascript in a webpage.

          I am pretty sure I will use arrays a lot in the future, adding things to them, removing things from them, and changing values in them.
          </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>
          I will most certainly use if/else expressions. We have begun using these already.
          </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>
          I will use nested "if" expressions too, like we did in the rock, paper, scissors game.
          </p>
