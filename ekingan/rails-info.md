#Rails homework - w06d3

1. Rails makes it really easy to get something working quickly!

2. The server is rails server, the database is sqlite3

3. A resource is a built in functionality of Rails

4. A controller receives specific requests from the application. A route decides which controllers receive which requests.

5. I think controller logic was in our app.js file.

6. The application.html.erb looks a lot like an ejs template.

7. Looing at the articles_controller.rb

	* ArticlesController < ApplicationController shows an inheritance

	* ArticlesController#new knows to display the article found with the params of the id as shows in def show.

	* @article has an @ so that the variable stays within it's class

8. Active record creates objects which need persistent storage to databases. I think this means that it is constantly updating?

9. Migrations are manage db schemas using a domain specific language.

10. A question I have about rails is how to create routes using ruby.
