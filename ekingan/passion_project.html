<p> My passion project is to create an online community for musicians. The site would allow members to create profiles, post want-ads, and connect with fellow musicians who share similar interests. Each member could create a custom profile with pictures, links to their musical work, accomplishments and influences. The profile would include their location, schedule availability, and the style of music they are interested in. They could also post ads for gear wanted or gear for sale. The forum would allow bands to search for bandmates, and for individuals to connect with others who are interested in collaborating. Musicians would be connected based on certain search criteria contained in each member's profile.

        To make my passion project I will move forward, one step at a time, until the project is complete.

        I will look for inspiration and support from friends, classmates, teachers, and within my music community.

        I will be patient with myself and my learning process.
