        <h1>We were asked</h1>
        <p>to write a few sentances about things we learned from the homework 
        we did tonight. Well, for one, I learned that I really like pair programming. 
        I programmed with Johnny tonight and it worked out great!
        <br>I learned about setting variables within jQuery and I learned about how
        to convert a value into an integer. I also learned a simple thing from one of the readings:</p>
        <ul><li> $("CSS Selector").someJqueryMethodName() works for getting a value</li>
        <li>$("CSS Selector").someJqueryMethodName(setterValue) works for setting a value.</li></ul>
        <p>I coincidentily listened to a podcast this morning about the creater of jQuery.</p>
        <p>I became more aware of the conventions for indenting code.</p>  
        <p>And I also learned the value of getting some rest. Goodnight!</p>
