		<p>One passion of mine is personal health (physcial, mental, spiritual, etc.).  This includes overall fitness and nutrition.  I firmly believe that maintaining one's health is key to performing their best in all aspects of life, as well as living the best and fullest life possible.  I enjoy learning more about how to improve your personal health as well as cooking simple tasty meals.  With the skills I will gain from WDI, I look forward to seeing how I can apply my knowledge about health and nutrition to help provide information to everyone.</p>

			<li>First and foremost, I need to know exactly what it is I want to code.  An app, game, or website?</li>
			<li>I will need plenty of patience and should expect things not to work out perfectly at the beginning.</li>
			<li>Adjust my mindset with more positive reinforcement so when I hit a wall, I know it's only a matter of time before I get through it.</li>
