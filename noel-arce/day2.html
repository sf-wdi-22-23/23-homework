      <h1>?'s About Homework</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the best way to solve the last question in the JavaScript exercise to put each person's information within a nesting array one-by-one?</li>
        <li>I still do not fully understand SWITCH statements, maybe because I rarely used them in Fundamentals. In what situation do you use them?</li>
        <li>I did not fully understand the section about CALLBACK.  What is a callback?</li>

      <h1>What I Will Use Later</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>I will most definitely need to be using all the keyboard shortcuts, plus more, that were covered in the linked video.</li>
        <li>I used IF/ELSE statements throughout most of Fundamentals, so I think I'll be relying on them alot.</li>
        <li>I also think I will be using FOR loops during much of the course.</li>
