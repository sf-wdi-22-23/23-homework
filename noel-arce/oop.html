		<div class='question'>What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?</div>
		<div class='answer'>A constructor is a function of a class, which creates a new object each time it is called. A prototype is a classless object (not 100% certain).</div>
		<div class='question'>What does this mean inside a constructor?</div>
		<div class='answer'><em>this</em> refers to the current object and let's you work with properies within object.</div>
		<div class='question'>Questions or Comments</div>
		<div class='answer'>I do not fully understand <em>prototype</em>, and would like to discuss this in more detail. Also from my understanding, <em>class</em> is a variable(var) defined as a function, and <em>constructor</em> is the function.  If I am correct, why can they not simply be called variable and function? The different names and terms confuse me.</div>
