###UX and Workflow

1. One of my favorite things to do is browse through Pinterest. I am an artist and designer and I love spending time being able to find work that other designers have done for referrence and inspiration. It's really convenient having boards with customizable themes and categories. And I love that I can find images that other users have posted. 

2. To build an app outside in, you have to know what it is your building and understand how you want to build it. This would start with user narratives to understand what potential users might be looking for. Then from understanding their needs, wireframe to get  an assortment of layout ideas for the app. Wireframing is essentially a blueprint for the app. You want to lay the foundation and then build the structure of the house before you start thinking about the details like painting the walls and hanging lace curtains.

3. Favorite debugging techniques: 
..* console logging everything
..* debugger



###Project 1 Review

1. Workflow: 
..* started with user narratives. Trying to get a sense of what a user might use the app for. 
..* wireframing. working with the layout, trying to find solutions for usability
..* work on main page layouts. used bootstrap to figure out the templating for the different pages. 
..* schemas and data structures. I knew this was going to take a long time for me to figure out so I wanted to allocate more time for this. And as expected, it did. :( Once it was solved, was able to then start rendering everything on my pages. 
..* last thing I did was tackling styling and custom css

2. I think I would keep the workflow that I was using. One thing I would change is, after wireframing, tackling the schemas and data because I personally need more time to get it all sorted. And then once that's resolved, the rest of the work would have gone much more quickly. 

3. I'm trying to render my mongo data properly on my page using EJS. I'm currently using 3 for loops and it seems I can't get the syntax right. I've tried a bunch of different ways to write the loops and tried creating new variables for the data. There are three schemas and there is both referenced and embedded data and I feel that it's probably because of this that I can't get it to render properly. 



###Resourcefulness

One of the Django authentication modules I found was DJANGO-ALLAUTH. While most Django apps separate local and social authentication, Allauth integrates both. You can manage multiple emails, incorporate an email address verification flow, connect multiple social accounts and store your FB access token so you an publish wall updates.
