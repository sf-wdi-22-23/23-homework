###Secure Passwords and the User Model

  * Instance method.

1.Is the User model's `password=` an instance method or a class method? What is it using BCrypt for?
  * Instance method. BCrypt is for salting and hashing the password.

1.Is the User model's `authenticate` an instance method or a class method? What does it use BCrypt for? What does it return if passwords match?
  * Instance method. It uses BCrypt to confirm that the password entered by the user is the same as the hash saved when user created account.
