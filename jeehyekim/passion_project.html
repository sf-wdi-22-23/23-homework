		<p>As an artist, I've had the opportunity to build relationships with other artists, illustrators, musicians, and fashion designers over the years, and I find myself constantly inspired and moved by their passion, talent and creativity. I am a firm believer that our collective creativity and ideas can impact history and offer solutions to problems to those in need. One way that people are already helping families and people in need are through microloans. My idea is to create a site where artists and other creatives can partner with a microloan provider and with a specific individual participating in their program. Artists can post a print or other product for sale and percentages of the proceeds would go toward the individual they've selected to support.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Stick with it - It's not going to happen over night. Think long term and have a plan.</li>
		<li>Naysayers will always say "nay" - Don't listen to them.</li>
		<li>Research. And then do more research - Look into the feasibility of creating a site like this. Research microloans, how they distribute the funds, and how they're kept accountable.</li>
		<li>Ask questions - I don't know everything nor do I pretend to. For a project like this, I know that I will have to ask a lot of questions to people who are involved with microloans or who have had experience with microloans. Also, ask questions about how the logistics for a site like this would work.</li>
