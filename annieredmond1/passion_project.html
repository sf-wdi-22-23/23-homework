	<p>I would love to create a program that helps people working through a 12 step program.  Specifically with regards to the 4th step.  So many people I've known get stuck on that step because it feels very overwhelming and many relapse because they are too overwhelmed to complete the step.  I would like to create something that breaks the step down one little peice at a time, so that more people can work through it and stay sober.
