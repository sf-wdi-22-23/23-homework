	<h1>List three input types and give real world examples of when you might use each of them. (ex. password inputs can be used for login forms)</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>password - if the page the user is wanting to navigate to is private, you may need a password form for the user to enter their password.</li>
		<li>checkbox - could be used on a to-do list to check off items that are completed.</li>
		<li>file picker - could be used if you want people to submit their resumes in your site.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>List other questions you have from the reading!</h1>
	<ol>
