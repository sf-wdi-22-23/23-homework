  <h3>What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?</h3>

  <p> A constructor is a method called at the moment an object is instantiated (created). It usually has the same name as the class containing it. The prototype is the first instance of a class, from which other instances are created and modeled after. It is the first version of a class.</p>

  <h3>What does this mean inside a constructor?</h3>

  <p>The .this refers back to the object that's being created.</p>
