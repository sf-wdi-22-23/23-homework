<p>I would like to make a user empowered website for music recommendations. This site would run like a normal music website in that it would provide weekly reviews of albums. But instead of the album being reviewed by only one person, my site would provide an unlimited amount. In this way, the review process would be made more democratic. For accessibility each user review would be limited to 500 words, and contain a score on a scale of 1 - 10. Reviews could be upvoted or downvoted and users would eventually increase their credibility on the site.

	<li>I found the TED talk insightful because I've had fixed mindsets about my own abilities, and I don't think they were helpful to my education. For instance, since high school I have avoided math and science classes after receiving a couple of middling grades. In truth, I have no idea whether I'm good at science/math or not. Because of this fixed mindset, I never made attempts to find out my abilities while I was in college.</li>
	<li>In the 'Things I Wish...' article I agree with the writer that knowing what you want to build is a great guiding principle in starting a career as a web developer. Already I've learned it is much more enjoyable to work on a project you have fun doing, and that increased interest will benefit the quality of the project itself.

	<li>During today's orientation as well as in the 'Things I Wish...' article, coding is referred to as a craft, like woodworking is a craft. I thought this was a very helpful analogy because it sets expectations for ones ability and goals. You can understand equate writing a simple program to building a birdhouse, and as your craft improves so does the complexity of your birdhouse.
