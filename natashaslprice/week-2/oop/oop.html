						<h2>What is the difference between a constructor and a prototype?</h1>
						<ul>
							<li>A constructor is the equivalent of a function in JavaScript. It sets the object's properties or method.</li>
							<li>A prototype is a 'parent' object that is set up to allow you to assign certain methods to other objects that are related.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h2>What does <b>this</b> mean inside a constructor?</h2>
						<p>Using <b>this</b> inside a constructor makes sure that the method is run on the current object.</p>
						<hr>
						<h2>Any questions?</h2>
						<p>Not at the moment! I am just interested to see how we use these...</p>
