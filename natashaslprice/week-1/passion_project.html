	<p>I think that the insurance market is a complete scam. People have insurance for pretty much everything, but hardly ever claim because of the time and effort involved. Furthermore, I believe that a lot of people pay for insurance for different things that actually overlap and cover the same items. For example, my scooter insurance covers the clothing I wear on my scooter, which is also covered by my contents insurance. When people travel they may pay for additional travel insurance to cover expensive items, like laptops, which may also be covered in their contents insurance. I would like to model the insurance market and look at whether it is possible to provide people with an all-inclusive insurance product. If I model the market and find out I am correct, then I will be very happy if I can build a website that collects data from people and runs it through a model to provide them with an idea for an insurance product!</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The most fundamental thing will be to build a model to determine whether my theory is correct!</li>
		<li>If I am right, and I move on to building my website, I will try to make my code as easy to read as possible using tabs and spaces where I can.</li>
		<li>While I write my code I want to make sure it uses the best practice or most efficient route. Iteration and refactoring will be key.</li>
		<li>Having some more experienced coders read parts of my more complicated code will be useful to sense check.</li>
		<li>In order to make my website attractive I will use an external .css file and will use classes and ids to identify between items.</li>
