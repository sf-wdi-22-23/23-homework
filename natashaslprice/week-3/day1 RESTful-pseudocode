We want to create an API that returns data about icecream. 
We need to be able to get information about specific flavors, as well as all of the flavors we have in our database. 
We also want to get some flavors by category, like "fruity", "gluten free", or "chunky". 
Finally we want to add one POST route that allows users of our api to add new flavors!

// My pseudo-code routes:

GET ALL FLAVORS "/flavors"
GET FLAVOR BY NAME "/flavors/:name"
GET FLAVOR BY CATEGORY "/category/:name/flavors"
POST NEW FLAVOR "/flavors"
